### 🔖 Tasks Completed

#### ✅ Task 1: Predictive Analytics Model

* Built a **regression model** to predict temperature using weather data.
* Used techniques such as:

  * **Data cleaning** and **feature engineering**
  * **ARIMA** time series forecasting
  * **XGBoost regression**
* Evaluated model performance using **RMSE** and plotted actual vs predicted values.

#### ✅ Task 3: Advanced Statistical Analysis

* Conducted **correlation analysis** to explore relationships between customer behavior and spending.
* Visualized data using:

  * **Heatmaps**
  * **Histograms**
* Derived actionable insights about spending trends and marketing response.

#### ✅ Task 4: Big Data Analysis

* Analyzed and visualized a **large customer dataset** with over 2,000 records.
* Performed:

  * Data preprocessing
  * Feature extraction from datetime fields
  * Creation of new metrics (e.g., `TotalSpent`)
* Used **efficient pandas operations** to handle and explore the dataset.
